gedit WindowDefaults


WindowDefaults is a gedit plugin, that allows to set fixed default settings for newly
opened windows. Without this plugin gedit will usually use the settings from a previously
opened window.

Currently the following settings are supported:

- window width
- window height



INSTALL

Copy the following files to ~/.gnome2/gedit/plugins:

windowdefaults.gedit-plugin
windowdefaults.py



HOW TO USE

Enable the plugin via the preferences ( Edit -> Preferences -> Plugins).

To set the default settings, use the menu item Edit -> Use As Default. This will use the
settings from the active gedit window as default. Once the default settings are set, gedit
will always use them when opening a new window
(settings are stored in ~/.gnome2/gedit/WindowDefaults.ini).

Until you have set the default settings for the first time, WindowDefaults will
always pick up the settings from the first opened window within a session.
